### User Stories

### Passenger User Stories

- As a passenger, I want to view the real-time locations of the buses on the map, so that I can check which bus should I take to my next stop,

- As a passenger, I want to see the availability of seats on the bus in real-time, so that I can know if the closet bus has any seats available.

- As a passenger, I want to scan the barcode of the driver to start and end a ride, so that I can reach my destination and add a feedback.

### Driver User Stories

- As a driver, I want to log in to start my shift, so that I can appear as active to the administration.

- As a driver, I want to show my barcode to to get scanned by user and update my location, so that user can have a seat in my bus where and to get his feedback when he arrives to his destination.

- As a driver, I want to chat with admin in case of any problem I face, so that in I can notice the administration or get noticed of any issue or important info.

### Admin User Stories

### B-ROUTE is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [React Native Expo development framework](https://reactnative.dev/). React Native is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile.
- For persistent storage (database), the app utilizes the [MySQL database](https://www.mysql.com/), enabling the creation of a custom storage schema and saving data to a local MySQL database.
- For server-side operations, this project leverages Laravel, a PHP framework known for its implementation of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural design pattern.
- For backend ap
- For chat system, the app uses the [Firebase Real-Time Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database) package which supports Android, iOS.
- For location tracking, the app uses [Expo Location Library](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/location/) which supports Android, iOS.
- For tracking seats, the app uses [ESP8266 Module](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266), which uses [HTTPClient](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/httpclient/) to send requests yo update the current state of seats.
