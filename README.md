<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title5.svg"/>

### B-ROUTE is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [React Native Expo development framework](https://reactnative.dev/). React Native is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile.
- For persistent storage (database), the app utilizes the [MySQL database](https://www.mysql.com/), enabling the creation of a custom storage schema and saving data to a local MySQL database.
- For chat system, the app uses the [Firebase Real-Time Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database) package which supports Android, iOS.
  - For location tracking, the app uses [Expo Location Library](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/location/) which supports Android, iOS.
- For tracking seats, the app uses [ESP8266 Module](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266), which send uses [HTTPClient](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/httpclient/) to send requests yo update the current state of seats.
- This project is hosted on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/websites/).
